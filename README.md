My CPU Files
==================================================================

## Introduction

These are various files pertaining to a CPU I designed and simulated using the
Logisim (and Logisim Evolution) logic simulator.  Tne instruction set HTML files
are in chronological order (as my CPU was improved) from the first video in my
Logisim CPU youtube video series to the eleventh.

## Simulator and Assembler

I have made a simulator with assembler that runs in your browser.  To access it
go to my [CPUsimulator](https://www.github.com/mrmcsoftware/CPUsimulator) repo.  You can also go to the [live demo](https://mrmcsoftware.github.io/CPUsimulator) but you would need to read the info in the repo to know how to use it well.
